## What's goin on!?
1. Run the server using `gulp` and it will show up on `localhost:3000` (index.html).

2. Sass files in `/sass` are compiled into `/css` and automatically injected/refreshed through browsersync.

3. etc?

## How to deploy
The files are hosted and served on a Webfaction account â€” check w/ @feesh if you don't have the login/password!
